# Best Friend Maker

It can be hard to make friends in this world. There are a lot of opinions about what makes a good friendship, but one thing is for sure: it helps if you have something in common.

If you can't a friend who has much in common with you, build one for yourself.

## The Program in Action

When you run *best_friend.py*, the output will look like this (Text input by the user is in **bold**):

<pre>
Hi. I'm the computer.
What's your name? <b>Mr. Baldus</b>
Hi, Mr. Baldus! What's your favorite color? <b>kelly green</b>
No way! My favorite color is also kelly green!
What's your favorite movie? <b>The Princess Bride</b>
What!?! My favorite movie is also The Princess Bride!
What is your favorite game? <b>soccer</b>
Get out of here! My favorite game is soccer, too!
What is your LEAST favorite pizza topping? <b>onions</b>
I dislike onions on my pizza! Just like you!
What is your favorite class? <b>I.T.</b>
Wow! My favorite class is I.T., as well!
We like all the same things! We should become best friends!

## What do I do?
The first interactions are shown. Study how they were done in order to fill in the blanks of the other interactions.


- You may need to refer your learners to a particular lesson,
task, or file. To achieve this, you can use the in-course links.
Specify the path using the `[link_text](course://lesson1/task1/file1)` format.

- You can insert shortcuts in the task description.
While **task.html/task.md** is open, right-click anywhere
on the **Editor** tab and choose the **Insert shortcut** option
from the context menu.
For example: &shortcut:FileStructurePopup;.

- Insert the &percnt;`IDE_NAME`&percnt; macro,
which will be replaced by the actual IDE name.
For example, **%IDE_NAME%**.

- Insert PSI elements, by using links like
`[element_description](psi_element://link.to.element)`.
To get such a link, right-click the class or method
and select **Copy Reference**.
Then press &shortcut:EditorPaste; to insert the link where appropriate.
For example, a [link to the "contains" method](psi_element://java.lang.String#contains).

- You can add link to file using **full path** like this:
  `[file_link](file://lesson1/task1/file.txt)`.
