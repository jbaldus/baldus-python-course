## Season Episode Renamer

I have a list of TV Episodes that are numbered sequentially, rather than in the more usual Season, Episode format. For example, Season 9, Episode 7 is in my list as Episode 182. I would like to convert each of these "global episode numbers" to a pair of numbers indicating the equivalent season and episode.

### Your task

Given a list `seasons` containing the number of episodes for each season--starting with season 0--write a function that takes the global episode number and the list `seasons` and returns a tuple (Season, Episode)
